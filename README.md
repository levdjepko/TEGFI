# TEGFI_1.0
<p>
  This is a final version of my <strong>Track Expenses</strong> app.
It is written in C# with Windows Forms. Backend-connectivity includes a custom MySQL database with DB authentication.
Also attached an animated GIF to show app functionality without installation / under non-Windows environment.
